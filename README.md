# Stack Overflow in Recursive Function

This repository demonstrates a stack overflow error in a recursive function written in Hack. The function `foo` calculates the factorial of a number.  When called with a large input, it exceeds the maximum recursion depth, resulting in a stack overflow.

The solution demonstrates how to avoid this error by using an iterative approach instead of recursion.
